Complex Computing Problem Of Deep Learning and Neural Networks : AI-Driven Urban Traffic Optimization with Ethical and Environmental

Modern urban environments face increasing challenges in traffic management due to rising vehicle populations,
environmental concerns, and the need for real-time decision-making. This paper presents a modular, AI-driven system for
optimizing urban traffic under ethical and environmental constraints. The proposed architecture integrates reinforcement
learning for adaptive signal control, variational autoencoders for anomaly detection, YOLOv5 and Deep SORT for real-time
object detection and tracking, environmental data fusion for sustainability-aware routing, and natural language processing
using BERT for event detection from social media feeds. These modules communicate dynamically to create an intelligent,
responsive traffic management system. The entire framework is validated using the SUMO traffic simulator, demonstrating
significant reductions in average waiting time, traffic congestion, and carbon emissions. Emphasis is placed on fairness,
adaptability, and scalability, ensuring that the system responds not only efficiently but equitably to real-world traffic scenarios.
This work contributes toward the development of next-generation smart cities that prioritize safety, efficiency, and environmental
responsibility.
